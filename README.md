🧑‍💻 JavaScript Intern — Role Description
As a JavaScript intern, I worked on building interactive features for websites and web apps. My main tasks involved:

Writing and testing JavaScript code to create dynamic web page behavior (like opening modals, handling button clicks, and responding to user actions).

Learning and applying best practices like using addEventListener for event handling and using functions to organize code.

Collaborating with front-end developers and designers to turn visual designs into working, interactive features.

Debugging issues using the browser’s developer tools and making improvements based on feedback.

Gaining hands-on experience with the Document Object Model (DOM) to control and update web page content and styles.
